      This website was created to help improve the way 
      <strong>Non-Conformance Reports (NCRs)</strong> are handled at Crossfire Niagara. 
      Right now, most NCRs are managed through Excel sheets, which can be slow 
      and confusing. Our system makes things easier by letting users enter NCR 
      details online and attach photos or videos.
